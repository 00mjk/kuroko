# Kuroko - A bytecode-compiled scripting language

This bytecode VM / compiler is substantially based on Robert Nystrom's [_Crafting Interpreters_](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

Instead of implementing Lox, I am aiming for a language with a syntax reminiscent of Python - one with significant whitespace and generally the same keywords.

At the moment, the intent for this project is to add a proper scripting language to Bim, to which both configuration scripts and syntax highlighting will be ported.

Kuroko, as its name should imply, will also be made available in ToaruOS as a general user language, and some utilities may end up being written in it.
